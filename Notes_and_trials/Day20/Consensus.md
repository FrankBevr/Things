# Notes

### Why do we need Consenus?
Nodes need to aggree what is right.
Without nodes, dont cant sync.
Not possible to build blocks

### What are pow and pos
pow = longest chain rule
pos = 

### Why not pow?
consumes stuff. like a lot. cartels are possible

### nominated pos
most stakes most power = the person with the most money

polkadot uses npos = roles nominator & validator

validotr = create block
nominator = select validators

### probalistic vs provable finality

probalist = calcuclate if block read

there are finailty gadget liek grandpa

### hybrid consesnus
There are tow proto
granpa and babe

thats bybrid whiel hbyrid

always produce block and always agree

### block production 

babe = bling assignemnt for blockchain extension

it selectes random validators

babes happens in epics. so eeepic.

#### multile validotsr per slot

oh man this languages

#### no validotrs in slot

there is a roundrobin style to solve it

#### Badass babes

it uses zk thingy, its work in progress

### Finality Granpa

its the last who is totally valid

### Briging Beefy

its a protocoll, 
Thats intersting

### Fork choice

Babe builds on granpa.
There is picture, thats sums it up

### Comparisons

### Nakamoits

more blocks on top of block as better

### Tendermit

something with cosmos

### Casper 

caser is something on etehreum i guess
