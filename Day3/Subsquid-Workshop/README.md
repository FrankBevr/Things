Project explaining.
Indexing a conract, something racecraft. Its kind of famous. It choosen because they have something on moonscan. Things that are not verify, try use standard erc20 abi. 
There is multicall contract, is an implentation of MakerDAo, kind of.
One is of Moonbeam. Its allows to aggreate multiple call. It improves performance.
Lets start project. Massimo has stuff. `sqd up`, `??`, `??`.
Its completed very quickly. What is he doing, he made class that calls substractclassBatch. Connected to Moonbeam. in .env there are rpc endpoint.
only transfers. a bunch of typescript. He launches a processer, he uses btches. he gets a bunch block, each blocks has a bunch of items. check item. Typescript does things. 
He uses a transfer Event. Imported Events. decoded logs. Then he saves stuff. 
Now I lost what he is speaking. He finds token. At the very end he instaniate the multicall contract interface. He pokes the multicall contract. There is a command `sqd serve`. Start a local thingy. axios allows to fetch stuff. Save 


Question: 
How to get all Data from 1st Block

How to build it?
`sqd init` start a new project
`sqd init angelhack`
`cd Anglehack`
`npm install`

`npm i -g @subsquid/cli@latest`
change .env file from moonriver, to moonbeam. Thats all neccesarry.

copy abi from moonscan

`sqd typegen src/exrr.json` Not available right now, copy something
