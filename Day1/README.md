There are 3 medium articles about Astar.

### Atricle one, with nice screenreader..

from hooon. 


Brigeds are baad.  multichain assets are great. Its a paper as it seams. xcm is a core thought about astar. future is many blockchains. more cooperate. Astar rates innovation high. A mulitchain vs interopertiable. Marketplace are calssical mulitchain. Nice talk but the complexitiy is definitly a hurdle to levearge all the benefits. Javascripts runs the world, as a example. multideploy is not necessary anymore. There is an AstarHub.
